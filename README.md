This research aimed to understand functional motor changes across phenotype groups in patients with Amoyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 109 patients were analyzed including demographic data, functional motor scores, and survival analysis. 

Purpose: Progressive disability occurs in persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (pALS), but can change over time across phenotypes remains understudied, limiting clinical decision making. This observational study describes functional motor change with detailed measures across phenotypes among pALS. 

Materials and Methods: Electronic Health record data from an interdisciplinary ALS clinic (n=109 pALS, 2018-2022), including demographics, disability (ALSFRS-R), and functional motor scores (10 Meter Walk, 5 Times Sit to Stand, Handheld dynamometry (grip, ankle)) was utilized. Phenotype groups were defined by site of onset (bulbar, upper limb, and lower limb). Analysis was conducted using R and included changes scores and measures of central tendency in 3-month intervals. 

Results: PALS were n=43 bulbar, n=32 upper limb, n=34 lower limb onset, age 65, 60-71 (median, IQR). Patterns of change seen included greatest loss of grip strength in bulbar and upper limb, ankle strength in upper limb, and walking speed in lower limb. Preservation of community ambulation ability was greatest in upper limb. ALFSRS-R decline was greatest in bulbar, but similar in upper and lower limb.   

Conclusion: While ALSFRS-R scores were similar, detailed functional motor measures revealed differences in metrics. These patterns provide insight into specific targets for intervention strategies and may help guide prognosis.
